- The size of the virtual machine
- The maximum number of virtual machines that can be created
- The operating system that the virtual machine runs
    Windows - Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019 and Windows servcer 2022
    Linux   - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS & 24.04 LTS, RHEL 7, 8, 9, SUSE Linux etc
- The configuration of the virtual machine after it starts
- The related resources that the virtual machine needs  - Datadisk 
- Required RBAC RBAC on Subscripiton - Contributor

Access tiers:
------------

Hot tier - An online tier optimized for storing data that is accessed or modified frequently. The hot tier has the highest storage costs, but the lowest access costs.
Cool tier - An online tier optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed or modified. Data in the cool tier should be stored for a minimum of 30 days. The cool tier has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the hot tier.
Cold tier - An online tier optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed or modified, but still requires fast retrieval. Data in the cold tier should be stored for a minimum of 90 days. The cold tier has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the cool tier.
Archive tier - An offline tier optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed, and that has flexible latency requirements, on the order of hours. Data in the archive tier should be stored for a minimum of 180 days.
